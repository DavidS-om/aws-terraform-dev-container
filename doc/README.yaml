usage: |
  Once you have opened your project with VSCode Dev Containers:
  1. In the terminal, export the AWS environment variables.
  2. Execute the following commands

  ```bash
  make pre-commit/run
  ```
  Notice the warnings and errors raised by [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec), [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov), and/or [terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan).
  These messages allow us to improve the security of our solution overall. For this tutorial, we will ignore them.

  ```bash
  make terraform/plan
  make terraform/apply
  make terraform/destroy
  ```

  To generate documentation powered by [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs):
  ```bash
  # you can combine two Make targets
  make terraform-docs/init terraform-docs/build
  ```

  To build your project's documentation
  ```bash
  make doc/build
  ````
  Notice the creation, or update, of the README.md.
  You can have a closer look into each Make target [here](.devcontainer/lib/make).
